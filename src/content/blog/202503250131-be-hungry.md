Looking back to when I started as a software developer 2.5 years ago, I’ve caused more prod downtimes than coffee breaks. Honestly, if there was a game for incident reports, I’d be on diamond 💎 tier by now.

<br/>
Being a naive developer was like being a baby giraffe on roller skates - awkward, confused, and constantly causing chaos. Meanwhile, the “10x engineers” around me (or at least the ones who claimed to be) were always ready to slam down their experience cards like they were playing Uno Reverse, just to remind me that I knew absolutely nothing.

Well, all of that was obviously just in my head—I basically turned into the Grinch, but instead of hating Christmas, I started hating people for knowing more than me. Every time someone dropped a technical term I didn’t understand, I questioned if I should quit and open a food truck instead.

But then, by some cosmic glitch or pure luck, my team changed—and suddenly, I was surrounded by the coolest seniors. These absolute legends not only listened to my weird questions but also formed a human firewall around me every time I “accidentally” broke production in the name of learning.

Thanks to their support, I developed the most important trait for a software development career — **faking confidence while frantically Googling everything in another tab**. Just kidding, that trait was being hungry for knowledge. Going to office became fun, everyday was like a
**mukabang**

People in my team talk about tech a lot—new frameworks, fancy algorithms, and occasionally, how they spent 3 hours stuck in Bangalore traffic after a Honey Singh concert. Truly, the **full-stack** experience. ⏱️

But if there’s one person who made me hungry for knowledge, it’s my manager—who also happens to be my best friend and mentor (yes, I lucked out). This guy already has a buffet of responsibilities, yet he still manages to snack on the latest tech trends like it’s no big deal.

One day, I asked him, “When do you even find time to read all this stuff?”—expecting some productivity hack straight out of a TED talk. He casually replies, “In the cab when coming to the office.” 🤣 That moment hit me harder than a Monday morning stand-up.

Why was I being the lazy one? If he could juggle a thousand things and still make time to stay updated, what was my excuse? I didn’t deserve this free time — I needed to step up and start munching on some knowledge too. 

Hence, I started devouring tech blogs, keynotes, Medium articles, you name it. If it had code or buzzwords, I was reading it. And cut to one year later, I no longer felt like a lost intern who Googled *“what is Kubernetes”* every other day. I had opinions, I felt confident, and for the first time, I actually knew where I was and where I wanted to go.

So, if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this:

Be Fat (with knowledge), Stay Hungry (for more), and Enjoy These (tech snacks, not just the free office cookies).

I am attaching some of the best websites where you can snack on your knowledge—because why should your brain stay hungry? 🍔💻
