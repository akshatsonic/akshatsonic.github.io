	I’m <strong style = 'color:#7c68ed'>Akshat Soni</strong>, a backend sorcerer 🧙‍♂️ who wrangles microservices, wrestles with cloud infrastructure, and occasionally breaks production (on purpose, I swear!). Here, I write about all things <strong>backend, cloud, databases, and software engineering</strong>, but with fewer corporate buzzwords and more memes.

   <p class="w-full text-justify text-base md:text-lg">
   I also dabble in photography, capturing the beauty of the world—because unlike my code, my photos don’t throw NullPointerExceptions. 📸
